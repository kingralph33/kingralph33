### Hi there, I'm Ralph 👋

### Brief History 📜
In 2016, I made a career change from retail banking to the tech industry.  Started out in the help desk at [Skyline Technology Solutions](https://www.skylinenet.net/) while I worked on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) lessons. I didn't stay in that department long. I was able to join the Internal Product team doing software quality assurance mainly using Javascript.

In 4th Qtr 2018, I attended [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) where I was successful at passing their 2 stack curriculum. The first stack was Python with Flask and Django. The second was the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular (we used Angular 7), and Node) stack. I am very thankful for Coding Dojo. It was challenging but very fun and fulfilling.

After graduating from Coding Dojo 1st Qtr 2019, I remained at Skyline and transitioned to Jr Developer. It varied with each project which language was used, but in summary I worked in PHP, Javascript, Python, and Java.

In 2020, I switched employers and now work for the Federal Government mainly coding in Java. Java 8 to be exact :unamused:

### Side Projects 🚧
I started my company, King Ralph LLC, in 2020 with the intention to build applications and release to the public. In the beginning it will probably be websites, but eventually I will also add some iOS Apps.

I am starting to get more free time after work so I plan on pushing to Github more now.  For my bootcamp I mainly used GitLab [KingRalph33](https://gitlab.com/kingralph33) because at the time Github did not allow multiple private repos. Since Github has made the change I mainly push to here.
